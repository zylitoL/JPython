Implementation of certain native Python3 functions in Java.

Many of my friends start programming in Python3 first before anything else and are used to specific built-in functions and syntax. The most notable example is how for-loops across some interval work. In Python, this is done by the means of the range() function, whereas in Java this is done by its own for-loop syntax. Here, I have replicated the Python funciton in Java with proper method overriding as well.
